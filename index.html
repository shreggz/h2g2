        <div class="hero-text">
            <p>Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one--more popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than Fifty More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes, and Who is this God Person Anyway?</p>
            <p>In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitchhiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects:</p>
            <p>First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly, it has inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover, the words:</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>The Babel Fish is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy not from its carrier, but from those around it. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them.</p>
                <p>The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish.</p>
                <p>The Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Dolphins</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much--the wheel, New York, wars and so on--whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man--for precisely the same reasons.</p>
                <p>Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to alert mankind of the danger; but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually gave up and left the Earth by their own means shortly before the Vogons arrived.</p>
                <p>The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double-backwards somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the "Star Spangled Banner," but in fact the message was this: So long and thanks for all the fish.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>This is the best drink in existence! It's a potent cocktail invented by Zaphod Beeblebrox. The effects have been likened to having your brains smashed out with a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.</p>
                <p>There are many voluntary organizations which will help to rehabilitate you after you've had one.</p>
                <p>Here are the instructions for mixing a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster yourself:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit.</li>
                    <li>Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V.</li>
                    <li>Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzine is lost).</li>
                    <li>Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.</li>
                    <li>Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle sweet and mystic.</li>
                    <li>Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle Zamphuor.</li>
                    <li>Add an olive.</li>
                    <li>Drink...but...very carefully...</li>
                </ol>
